# Software Engineering Foundations

## My Role

As part of Cargill’s broader digital transformation, I spearheaded the creation and rollout of the **Software Engineering Foundations** — a strategic, forward-looking framework that enables engineering teams to deliver secure, scalable, and high-quality software at speed.

I championed this initiative to bridge modern engineering principles with practical execution, helping teams across the enterprise adopt a common set of standards while embracing autonomy and innovation.

## **What I Delivered**

### Architecture-First Principles  
I standardized a **cloud-first, API-first** model for application design, ensuring that:

- All greenfield apps are deployed on the Cargill Cloud Platform via *Captain* pipelines  
- APIs are designed as first-class citizens, abstracting backend complexity and supporting multi-channel consumption  
- All APIs are secured and exposed via Cargill’s API Gateway or Middleware Gateway (on-prem)
- Architecture reviews happen in phases and are tracked through TGRC and ARM governance

**_Additional Enhancements:_**

- Introduced **modular architecture** principles to support separation of concerns and ease of future scaling  
- Evangelized **event-driven architecture** for asynchronous processing and loose coupling using tools like Kafka and Pulsar

---

### Scalable Engineering Tooling  
I helped teams implement and standardize:

- GitHub Enterprise with branching strategies like GitFlow and GitHubFlow  
- CI/CD pipelines that automate build, test, scan, and deploy stages  
- Semantic versioning across all deployable artifacts  
- Monitoring and alerting with Datadog, integrated into sprint feedback loops  
- Docker and Kubernetes-based containerization across services

**_Additional Enhancements:_**

- Integrated **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform for consistent environment provisioning  
- Adopted **progressive delivery** practices (canary, blue-green) for safe and iterative deployments

---

### Secure by Design  
Security is embedded from day one:

- Federated authentication using Azure AD (internal) and Okta (external)  
- Secrets management outside source control using CI/CD vaults  
- Static and dynamic analysis tools (Veracode, Checkmarx) built into CI pipelines

**_Additional Enhancements:_**

- Promoted **Zero Trust Architecture** principles, especially in cloud-hybrid setups  
- Mandated use of **dependency scanning** and SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) for open-source transparency

---

### Shift-Left Quality Practices  
To ensure we catch issues early and often:

- CI pipelines enforce code coverage, static analysis, and linting  
- Automated regression and integration tests run on every merge  
- Manual or exploratory testing is mapped back to requirements

**_Additional Enhancements:_**

- Encouraged adoption of **contract testing** for APIs (e.g., Pact)  
- Promoted **Test Data Management (TDM)** practices to ensure clean, reusable test environments

---

### Aligned Tech Stack Governance  

Each application’s tech stack must align with the portfolio’s approved stack. Deviations are allowed only with a valid business justification — documented in GitHub and reviewed during architecture intake.

**_Additional Enhancements:_**

- Maintained a **Tech Radar** of approved, emerging, and deprecated technologies to guide team decisions

---

### End-to-End Documentation & Traceability  
Documentation isn’t just a checkbox — it’s built into the workflow:

- All codebases include `README.md`, architecture overviews, and deployment instructions  
- Every commit and PR links to user stories (Jira) for audit-ready traceability  
- Test cases are linked back to requirements and tracked throughout CI

**_Additional Enhancements:_**

- Implemented **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** to track system evolution over time  
- Promoted **diagrams-as-code** (e.g., using Mermaid or PlantUML) in repos for versioned architectural documentation

## Impact to community

These foundations are now core to how engineering is practiced at Cargill. They've helped:

- Streamline onboarding for new engineers and vendors  
- Improve the reliability and security of applications across business units  
- Enable faster, safer releases with clearer ownership and quality gates  
- Foster a community of engineering excellence through shared standards
