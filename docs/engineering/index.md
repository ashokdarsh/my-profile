# Software Engineering Standards & Practices Overview

At the core of my engineering philosophy is engineering excellence at scale — driven by automation, security, DevOps culture, cloud-native architecture, and a strong product mindset. I’ve led the modernization of platforms and practices across global teams by embedding best-in-class software engineering principles throughout the SDLC.

### **WHAT** _is the context and scope_ of this section?

These engineering practices provides guidelines and coding standards for any team writing code. These guidelines are representative to what has been practiced over the years and also based on new digital strategies as foundation for the future. Notice that not all guidelines have a clear rationale. Some of them are simply industry standards. 

### **WHY** _do we need these?_

- Gives a uniform appearance and consistency to the code written by different engineers.
- Improves readability, and maintainability of the code, and it reduces complexity.
- Helps in code reuse and helps to detect error easily.
- Promotes sound coding practices and increases efficiency of the engineers.
- Increases the efficiency of the software and reduces the development time.
- Helps in detecting errors in the early phases, so it helps to reduce the extra cost incurred by the software project.

### **WHEN** _should these be followed?_

- A new product development is started, the engineering team should reference these practices so the team is on the same understanding.
- A new engineer is onboarding to Cargill or to an Engineering team
- Any modernization effort which involves re-engineering / refactoring code to a different language

### **WHERE** _can these be applied?_

To any app development effort - Cloud, On-Prem, API, Big Data, Analytics, ML, AI, Mobile etc..

### **WHO** _is the audience?_

- Anyone who's developing code - Engineers, Data Scientist, Automation Engineers, Mobile engineers, API Engineers, Architects, and more
- Team Leads who manage teams, Peer reviewers
