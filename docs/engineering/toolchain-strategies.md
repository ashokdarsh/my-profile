# Engineering Toolchain & CI/CD - Strategies

## CI/CD Pipeline Design

CI/CD is tied directly to Git workflows:

- Feature branches trigger build/test pipelines  
- PRs run quality and security checks  
- Merges to `main` or `develop` deploy to DEV  
- Tags trigger Stage/Prod via *Captain pipeline*  
- Pipelines include lint, test, scan, build, deploy, and notify steps

## Risk-Aware Release Strategies

To enable safe and reliable delivery at scale, I introduced **progressive delivery techniques**:

- **Canary Deployments** for gradual rollout validation  
- **Blue-Green Deployments** with instant rollback support  
- **Feature Flags** to decouple deployment from release (future roadmap)

These approaches empower teams to deploy frequently, test in production safely, and reduce the risk of breaking changes.

## Developer Experience Enhancements

I focused on building a better engineering experience:

- Self-service CI/CD pipeline templates and starter repos  
- Pre-commit hooks for automated linting and checks  
- Onboarding documentation and code scaffolding  
- Docker-based local environments and developer tooling setups

## How We Measure Success

I introduced engineering KPIs and metrics to continuously improve velocity and quality:

- **Deployment Frequency**
- **Lead Time for Changes**
- **Change Failure Rate**
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**
- **Pipeline Success Rates**
- **Test Coverage Trends**

These metrics drive retrospectives and inform delivery improvements across pods.

## Built-in Audit Readiness

To support compliance and traceability:

- Every commit, tag, and deployment is traceable to a user story or issue  
- Logs, alerts, build metadata, and release artifacts are centrally retained  
- Code security scan results are reported and auditable for releases
